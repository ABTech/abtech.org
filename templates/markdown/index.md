The <strong>Activities Board Technical Committee</strong>, commonly known as <strong>AB&nbsp;Tech</strong>,
is the student organization charged with handling the technical production of Carnegie Mellon sponsored
events, including all events organized by the <a href="http://activitiesboard.org" target="_blank">Activities
  Board</a>. We provide high quality, professional grade entertainment production services, including sound
reinforcement, lighting design, and event management at heavily subsidized rates to the Carnegie Mellon
University community. Our clients include student groups, university faculty & administration, and
various independent companies and other organizations.

AB Tech provides technical support in three core areas:

* Sound Reinforcement

In addition to these three areas, we coordinate associated needs and services such as multi-phase/high-load
power, rigging & trussing, staging rentals, backline rentals, and more.
