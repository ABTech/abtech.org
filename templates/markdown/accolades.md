>My entire team can truly not thank you enough. AB Tech was professional,
knowledgeable,
and fantastic to work with. It was so great knowing that I could rely on your
entire
team to make the event not only happen, but go off without one hitch. Thank
you for all
of your hard work and efforts! We appreciate it and truly could not have done
it without you!
We look forward to working with you again in the future!

>Thank you so much for your help and support surrounding the Hagit Yaso
concert.
The event was a great success and we hope you enjoyed it as well.
We couldn't have put on such a large scale production without your support.
We look forward to continuing our relationship in the future.

>On behalf of Bhangra in the Burgh 7's Executive Board and Staff we would
like to say
thank you so much for all your hard work for BIB. We've been getting a lot
of compliments
from many of the teams who came to BIB7 about how smoothly the show was run
and ABTech
played a huge part in this. The lighting and music were great and the mics
were on point
(especially for Deewane). Thank you so much so being so flexible with the
last minute
changes with the lighting and the show schedule--we know it could not have
been easy.

>Just wanted to thank you all for your help with the Mayur Show this weekend!
You all really played a huge role in making the show such a success.
Despite all the confusion and lack of preparation on our part, you were able
to adapt
quickly and did a great job with all the lights, mic tech, and backstage
organization!
We really appreciate your cooperation and involvement, and we wish you all the
luck
with all things ABTech and more for the rest of this semester.
