{% autoescape off %}[AB Tech] Greetings {{ andrew_id }}!
Hi {{ first_name }}!

You're receiving this email because you were added to our mailing list. If you would like to be removed, let us know by replying to this email.

To learn more about AB Tech and what we do:

1. Check out the rest of our website at https://www.abtech.org
2. Check out our calendar at http://bit.ly/ABTechCalendarF20
3. Email us if you have any questions.

Once the semester starts, we will hold weekly training meetings where we will cover a topic relevant to live event support. Keep track of the meetings you attend, and after you reach 3 trainings, email abtech@andrew.cmu.edu and we will onboard you as a member of AB Tech.

Here's some jargon you may need to know to understand future emails:

Call time: the time you show up.
Show time: the time the event actually begins
Strike time: the time you show up for cleanup
HoT: Head of Tech (me)
TiC: Techie in Charge (the person who is in charge of the individual event)
FoH: Front of House (sound) person
LD: Lighting Designer
SM: Stage Manager

While this semester is unideal due to the lack of live events, we are always excited for new techies. We look forward to working with you once campus begins to return to normal!

If you ever have any questions about anything, don't hesitate to email abtech@andrew.cmu.edu, and I or someone from our officer team will get back to you shortly.

Thanks,
Ryan Eckert and Bobby Zhang
Heads of Tech{% endautoescape %}
