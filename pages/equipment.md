# Equipment

<hr class="bg-primary"/>

Our inventory and equipment configuration is constantly changing as we modify existing setups and acquire new gear to better meet the needs of the organizations we work with. Some large events require nearly our entire inventory all in one place, and other times our gear is divided between a half-dozen small events occurring simultaneously across campus.

Please note that parts of this list may be out of date or inaccurate. This page is a general reference only.
We will design an appropriate system for your event based on the event requirements you send us.
