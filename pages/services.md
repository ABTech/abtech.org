## What We Provide

AB Tech provides sound and lighting services to organizations affiliated with or planning events at Carnegie Mellon University. Most events we support are on-campus, but we also assist with a few select off-campus events each year. We provide significant discounts to Carnegie Mellon affiliates compared to the same services from external vendors.

        <h3 class="card-title">Sound Reinforcement</h3>
        <p class="card-text">From small lectures and vocal performances to dance parties, large bands, and concerts, we are experienced in the art of sound reinforcement. Nearly all events, indoors or outdoors, can be handled with our own inventory. As necessary, we can also bring in required instruments and other equipment.</p>

        <p class="card-text">You've probably seen our lighting, be it the inside of the Orientation Tent, lights illuminating the walls of the University Center, or the lighting behind KPDC and DS. We can provide lighting for almost any need imaginable, whether it's mood lighting for your club social or pyrotechnics and an industry-grade lighting rig for the next AB Concert.</p>

        <p class="card-text">In addition to Sound and Lighting, AB Tech also provides the following as support and standalone services. </p>
        <p class="card-text"><strong> Staging: </strong>If your event requires staging material, we can coordinate the rental of stage components from outside contractors. We do not carry any staging ourselves.</p>
        <p class="card-text"><strong> Stage Management: </strong>Many events require close coordination between you and our crew for smooth operation. Our crew can coordinate performers moving on and off stage, playback of sound and video components, and lighting cues.</p>
        <p class="card-text"><strong> Power: </strong>Larger shows, especially those with complex lighting requirements, will require more than wall power. We can provide, coordinate, and operate large power systems for you.</p>
        <p class="card-text"><strong> Rigging: </strong>Shows that require overhead rigging will require safe assembly and operation of all rigging equipment. We carry an array of rigging gear and are able to plan and assemble a rig suitable for your needs.</p>

AB Tech does not officially provide video services other than large-format projection. We do not have large projection surfaces or recording/streaming equipment. If your event requires these services, we may subcontract [cmuTV](http://www.cmutv.org/){:target="_blank"} or [another local production company]({{ '/external/' | relative_url }}) at an additional charge. Similarly, AB Tech does not own any backline equipment (guitar amplifiers, drums, keyboards, or other musical instruments), but we are happy to help coordinate the appropriate rentals through a local backline rental company.

**What we charge:** Our charges are based on the configuration of equipment being used and the personnel required to run your event. Thus, the cost of providing technical support for a show varies with the size and complexity of the event. Shows that require outside rentals typically cost more than those that do not. You will receive a customized, itemized quote once we receive the details of your event.

**Other options:**  
If AB Tech is not available to work your show, you may want to check out our
[production contractors page]({{ '/external/' | relative_url }}).
