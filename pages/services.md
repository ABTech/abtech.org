## What We Provide

AB Tech provides sound and lighting services to organizations affiliated with or planning events at Carnegie Mellon University. Most events we support are on-campus, but we also assist with a few select off-campus events each year. We provide significant discounts to Carnegie Mellon affiliates compared to the same services from external vendors.

        <h3 class="card-title">Sound Reinforcement</h3>
        <p class="card-text">From small lectures and vocal performances to dance parties, large bands, and concerts, we are experienced in the art of sound reinforcement. Nearly all events, indoors or outdoors, can be handled with our own inventory. As necessary, we can also bring in required instruments and other equipment.</p>

### Production Services

**Staging:** If your event requires additional staging material, we can coordinate the rental of stage components from outside contractors. We do not carry any staging ourselves.

**Stage Management:** We will make sure that your show runs smoothly. We will coordinate performers moving on and off stage, playback of sound and video components, and lighting cues.

**Power:** Larger shows, especially those with complex lighting requirements, will require more than wall power. We can provide, coordinate, and operate large power systems for you.



AB Tech does not officially provide video services other than large-format projection. We do not have large projection surfaces or recording/streaming equipment. If your event requires these services, we may subcontract [cmuTV](http://www.cmutv.org/){:target="_blank"} or [another local production company]({{ '/external/' | relative_url }}) at an additional charge. Similarly, AB Tech does not own any backline equipment (guitar amplifiers, drums, keyboards, or other musical instruments), but we are happy to help coordinate the appropriate rentals through a local backline rental company.

**What we charge:** Our charges are based on the configuration of equipment being used and the personnel required to run your event. Thus, the cost of providing technical support for a show varies with the size and complexity of the event. Shows that require outside rentals typically cost more than those that do not. You will receive a customized, itemized quote once we receive the details of your event.

**Other options:**  
If AB Tech is not available to work your show, you may want to check out our
