<p>AB Tech provides sound and lighting services to organizations affiliated with or
planning events at Carnegie Mellon. Most events are on-campus, but we also
assist with a few select off-campus events each year.</p>
<p>We can assist your organization's event in a number of areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sound reinforcement:</strong> From small vocal performances to dance
  parties to large bands, we are
  experienced in the art of sound reinforcement. Most events can be handled
  with our own inventory,
  providing great discounts off rental prices at external companies. As
  necessary, we can also
  rent equipment and bill you at-cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lighting:</strong> We can provide lighting for small shows using poles or
    floor lighting, or setup
    spans of lighting truss overhead for larger events. We have traditional
    colored lighting as well
    as LEDs, moving lights, strobes, and black lights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Staging:</strong> If your event requires additional staging material, we
    can coordinate the rental of
    stage components from outside contractors. We do not carry any staging
    ourselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Power:</strong> Larger shows (especially those with complex lighting
    requirements) will require
    more than wall power. In some cases, generators are rented to supply this
    additional power.
    We can coordinate this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>AB Tech does not officially provide video services (including
projector/screen rentals, video recording/filming of events, playback of
slideshows, DVDs, etc.). If your event requires these services, we may
subcontract <a href="http://www.cmutv.org/" target="_blank">cmuTV</a> or <a
    href="/external">another local production company</a> at an
additional charge. Similarly, AB Tech does not own any backline equipment
(guitar amplifiers, drums, keyboards, or other musical instruments), but we
are happy to help coordinate the appropriate rentals through a local
backline rental company.</p>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong>
<ul>
  <li><b>Precise show information:</b> To book an event, we need at minimum:
    <ul>
      <li>sponsoring organization (i.e. who will be paying for our
        services?)
      </li>
      <li>type of event (describe in detail what will be happening so we can
        provide the right equipment/staff)
      </li>
      <li>venue (please be precise -- such as "UC Rangos 1-3" instead of just
        "Rangos")
      </li>
      <li>setup time (see "Setup and teardown time" in bold below for more
        details)
      </li>
      <li>show date, time(s), and estimated length</li>
      <li>any other relevant information or special requests</li>
    </ul></p>
<p><li><b>Advance notice:</b> At least one week advance notice of the event.
    Larger events require more lead time (usually 2 weeks or more). We
    recommend that
    you contact us as soon as possible to make sure we can fit you in our
    schedule, as
    we frequently work multiple events simultaneously and have limited staff
    &amp; equipment.
    Changes (venue, times, equipment needs, etc.) or cancellations to the
    event less than 48
    hours before the show may not be possible, and may incur an additional
    late notice fee.
  </li></p>
<p><li><b>Setup and teardown time:</b> Please contact us before reserving a
    venue and
    confirming show time, so that we can estimate the time required for our
    setup and teardown.
    Smaller shows may only require an hour for setup, but larger shows may
    require 8 hours or more.
    We need full access to the venue from the setup time through the end of
    our teardown, which can
    be for up to a few hours following the end of the show (again, depending
    on the complexity).
  </li></p>
<p><li><b>Technical riders and contracts:</b> If performers have provided you
    with technical
    "riders" or requirements in their contract, it is best for us to have a
    copy of these to
    ensure they are met. Additionally, contact information for the performer
    is often useful
    if we need to request a clarification on technical requirements.
  </li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>What we charge:</strong>
Our charges are based on the configuration of equipment being used and the
personnel required to run
your event. Thus, the cost of providing technical support for a show varies
with the size and complexity
of the event. Shows that require outside rentals typically cost more than
those that do not. Recognized
student organizations receive more heavily subsidized pricing than other
organizations.
You will receive a customized quote once we receive the details of your event.</p>
<p><strong>How to submit a request:</strong><br />
If you are interested in having in AB Tech provide technical support for
your event, please fill our our <a href="/request">event request form</a>.
Expect a reply within a couple of days; if you don't hear back from us
within a reasonable period of time, feel free to follow up with another
email (we get a lot of requests and occasionally one will be misfiled).</p>
<p><strong>Other options:</strong><br />
If AB Tech is not available to work your show, you may want to check out our
<a href="/external">production contractors page</a>.</p>
